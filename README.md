Data Science: analytics for health and medicine WHO

In this project I used data from reliable sources such as Johns Hopkins and the WHO;
I learned to seek out and question data sources;
Cleaned, processed, analyzed, compared the information found;
I also learned the importance of proper visualizations and created a critical spirit by raising limitations in data studies;
I used programming knowledge and data analysis to calculate the rates of infected, recovered, deaths and lethality in the health area;
Finally, I understood the difficulty of achieving stable data during an episode like the COVID-19 Pandemic.
